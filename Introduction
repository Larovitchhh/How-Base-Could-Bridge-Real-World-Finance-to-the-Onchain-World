The financial world is at a turning point. Traditional finance, with its centralized institutions, legacy systems, and often exclusionary practices, is being challenged by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. At the forefront of this transformation is Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, designed to make onchain transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible. By leveraging its scalability, low costs, and integration with Coinbase’s vast ecosystem, Base has the potential to bring real-world finance (RWF) into the onchain world, creating a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent financial system. This article explores how Base can bridge these two worlds and the implications for the future of finance.
