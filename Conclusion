Base is more than just an Ethereum L2—it’s a bridge between the centralized, often inaccessible world of traditional finance and the decentralized, open world of blockchain. By leveraging Coinbase’s infrastructure, low-cost transactions, and a developer-friendly ecosystem, Base is poised to bring real-world finance onchain, transforming how we save, invest, and transact. While challenges like regulation and user adoption remain, Base’s early success and growing ecosystem signal a future where the boundaries between offchain and onchain finance blur, creating a more equitable and efficient global economy.
