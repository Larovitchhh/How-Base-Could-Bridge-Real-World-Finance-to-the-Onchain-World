Base is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution built using the Optimism OP Stack. Launched by Coinbase in 2023, Base aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly platform for decentralized applications (dApps). As an L2, Base processes transactions off Ethereum’s main chain while inheriting its security, significantly reducing gas fees and improving transaction speeds. With Coinbase’s backing, Base benefits from a massive user base, regulatory expertise, and infrastructure, positioning it as a key player in bringing real-world financial systems onto the blockchain.
