While Base has immense potential, challenges remain:Regulatory Uncertainty: Global regulations for DeFi and tokenized assets are still evolving, and Base must navigate this complex landscape to ensure compliance.
User Experience: Despite Base’s simplicity, onboarding non-technical users to DeFi requires further improvements in wallet interfaces and education.
Security Risks: While Base inherits Ethereum’s security, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or dApps could deter mainstream adoption.

Coinbase’s expertise in compliance and user experience positions Base to address these hurdles, but ongoing innovation and collaboration with regulators will be critical.
