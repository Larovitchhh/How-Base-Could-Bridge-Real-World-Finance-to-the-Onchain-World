Base’s vision extends beyond replicating traditional finance onchain—it aims to redefine it. By enabling instant, low-cost transactions, tokenizing real-world assets, and empowering the unbanked, Base could create a financial system that is more inclusive, efficient, and transparent. Imagine a world where a small business in Africa can access global capital markets, or where individuals can invest in fractionalized real estate without intermediaries—all powered by Base.As adoption grows, Base could become the backbone of a hybrid financial system, blending the best of real-world finance with the onchain world. Coinbase’s commitment to building “the most open, global crypto economy” suggests that Base will continue to innovate, potentially integrating advanced features like AI-driven financial tools or cross-chain interoperability.
