Real-world finance operates through banks, payment processors, and regulated institutions, handling everything from savings accounts to cross-border payments. However, it’s plagued by inefficiencies: high fees, slow settlement times, limited access for the unbanked, and opaque processes. In contrast, the onchain world—powered by blockchains like Ethereum—offers transparency, immutability, and permissionless access but faces challenges like scalability, user experience, and regulatory uncertainty.Bridging these worlds requires a platform that can combine the accessibility and compliance of traditional finance with the decentralization and efficiency of blockchain. Base is uniquely positioned to do this, leveraging Coinbase’s infrastructure and its L2 capabilities to create a seamless on-ramp for real-world financial systems.
